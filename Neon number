Rahul's teacher gave an assignment to all the student that when they show up tomorrow they should find a special type of number and report her.
He thought very carefully and came up with an idea to have neon numbers
. A neon number is a two digit number where the square of the sum of each digit of the number results in the given number.
Given an integer N, Write a programto find whether the number N is a Neon number.
